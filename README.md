# Broken Drifter

Broken Drifter is a small drift racing game based on my physics logic. It was made from scratch in a short time to test the manually recreated framework with some own features, practice making games without an engine, and improve my hard skills. The development of the framework was accompanied by learning how to develop a game engine from videos, so the framework code is almost identical to the early stage of https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

The goal was to make the game in a short time, so the development finished on the early version
