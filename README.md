# Broken Drifter

Broken Drifter is a small drift racing game with my own physics logic. It was made from scratch in a short time to test the framework and practice making games without an engine. The development of the framework was accompanied by learning how to develop a game engine from video, so framework code is almost similaer to https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

Controls:

WASD - movement. Space - handbrake. R - change camera


The goal was to make the game in a short time, so the development is currently frozen and delayed

TODO:

Fix backward drive;
Fix collisioin;
Improve physic;
Refactor code (change variables names, export the code to functions);
Make optimization (remove excess math operations, add conditions that more efficient than expressions );
Add particles;
Add Main Menu;
Add Bots;
Add map generation from file;
Add decorations;
